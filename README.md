Sending emails with Yandex

In this particular case, I am simulating a very simple Email Verification system

## Guideline

First you need to satisfy these requirments: 

1. `Yandex Account`
2. `Yandex App Password (Third-party password)`
3. `Allowing to use a mail client to retrieve your Yandex mail`

### Yandex App Password

Create your app password from here: passport.yandex\security\app passwords\yandex mail

### Allowing to use a mail client to retrieve your Yandex mail

And from here give the access

## Important Notes

**_If your email get rejected because of SPAM, change the subject & body_**
